# CompilerConstruction

## Project 1
### Lexical Analyzer
The first phase of the compiler project involves the design and implementation of the lexical analyzer.  The lexical analyzer may be written in a language of your choice (C/C++, Java, Python, etc.).  Students interested in pursuing careers in compiler construction, code analysis and reverse engineering or cyber operations should program their projects in C.

The analyzer should be designed as a separate program that will be invoked by the parser (Project 2).  It should read each line of the source program (with no more than 72 characters per line) into a 72 character buffer, generate tokens, produce a listing file with line numbers, and detect and print the appropriate error messages.
